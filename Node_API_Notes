The packages we are going to need are:
Nodemon - to restart node server and update any changes we make
=> npm i --save-dev nodemon

Dotenv - to create environment variables
=> npm i dotenv

Then, we create index.js file - and we add "start": "nodemon index.js" in the package.json file, under the scripts so that we can start the node server from that file
then we start the server by:
=> npm start

To install thunder client (to send http requests) go to extension and type thunder client

When working on the POST method file, we need to use something called the body parser, which can be provided by Express, since we are not using Express, then we need 
to install the body parser then we pass the input request. We are going to install something similar to the parser to stream the data from the client to the server. 
We create a Folder called utilities, within it, we create a file called body-parser.js
